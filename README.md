# 1024-Topics

The goal of this repository is to serve as a collection of introductory answers to topics and problems that I get regularly approached with (that are also not easily solved via web search). As such, articles will be as short and concise as possible, and simplified/oversimplified where necessary (oversimplifications will be noted). Each article will contain as many relevant reference and tool links as possible, and these should be used to validate information in the page, as well as stepping stones for more complicated/technical answers.

Feel free to request a topic by opening an issue, and tagging it as a topic request!

If you utilize this knowledge in any way, please provide a link back so others can take advantage of it too.
